  Meeting <http://bccp.berkeley.edu/beach_program/index2014.html>`_
* BCCP and the Instituto Avanzado de Cosmologia Mexico held the 5th
  Essential Cosmology for the Next Generation meeting on January
  13-17, 2014, popularly known as Cosmology on the Beach. The
  conference blends a winter school of lecture courses by
  world-leading scholars with plenary talks on hot research
  topics. This year, topics included CMB polarization, gravitational
  wave cosmology, particle physics, tests of gravity, and statistical
  and experimental methods. To see slides from the BCCP/IAC meeting
