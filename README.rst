website
=======

Source for Nikola-built website for bccp.berkeley.edu.

With [nikola](http://getnikola.com) (v7.0+) installed:

- `nikola build` will build the site in the `output` directory.
- `nikola serve` will start a local webserver to preview the site.

The site uses a custom theme based on nikola's built-in bootstrap3
theme. The custom theme allows us to:

-  use a drop-in bootstrap.css replacement from bootswatch.
-  Tweak various aspects of the generated HTML, such as titles, links
   and listings.

Logo
----

There are a few logo files in the `files` directory:

- `logo.svg`: An "Inkscape SVG" file, which is the main source.

- `logo_54.png`: A PNG generated by exporting the logo in Inkscape.

- `logo_square.svg`: Inkscape SVG file with just the logo part (no text).

- `logo_square_32.ico`: A favicon used in the site. Generated from the
  by exporting the square logo to PNG in Inkscape then converting
  using ImageMagick: `convert logo_square_32.png logo_square_32.ico`.
  
Subsites
--------

We are testing out a way to include static subsites for conferences. The current protocol
is to

- add the content of the subsite as a github repository. ('website-xxxxx')

- add a line in subsites.txt with four entries (separated by vertical line "|" 

.. code::

	repourl | sitename | sitetype | relpath

where sitetype can be `html` or `nikola`. relpath can be "." (for html) or "output" for nikola.

The bot on the server will clone and copy relpath to the subsite.
